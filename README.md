I made this software for the "Ukrainian Fishtank" 

Version 2.00----

What it does is live translates the words spoken in YouTube livestreams (that are in Russian) to English. 
It uses a open source translator called Argos (https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate) and uses another open source software for recognizing speech called Vosk (https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-space/blob/master/models.md) 

How to use the program:

	1.Launch the exe
	2.Input the URL of the livestream you want to translate 
	3.Click "Start Translation"

Minimalist Mode: 

	I have created a minimalist mode that once toggled on will make the program a semi-transparent window featuring only the text box.

Note: 

	This software was made rather hastily so it is bound to have bugs, as of 8/13/2024 I am still supporting this software so if there are bugs please report them to me and I will fix them, users are welcome to modify my code themselves it is open source.
